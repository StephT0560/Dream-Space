# Dream-Space
A Book Social Network Platform

## Main Files:
`books.py` – provides book recommendation search
`app.py` – main site file
`model.py` –
`forms.py` – template to create forms for user registration/login

## Installations & Imports
#### Google Books API
In order to have access to the Google Books API, you will need to have a Google account. After you login to or create your Google account, you must do the following:
1. Visit console.cloud.google.com
2. Click on ***Select a Project*** in the menu bar and then select ***New Project*** and name the project something relevant.
3. After you have a project, locate the ***APIs & Services*** option in either the tabs on the side of the page or the ***Quick Access*** Dashboard and click. Once you have arrived at the ***APIs & Services*** page, select the ***ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES*** option at the top.
4. When you reach the ***Welcome to the API Library*** screen, search for books and select the ***Books API*** option. Enable the API. 
5. Once you have enabled the API, return to the ***APIs & Services*** Screen and select ***Credentials*** from the sidebar. Once on the page, select ***Create Credentials*** and create and store the generated key. This key is required in the URL for use of `GET` and `POST` requests with the Google Books API.
6. (Optional) To learn more about the requests you can use in the Google Books API, vist this guide on https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using

#### books.py 
To begin, install the Google Books API on your terminal for python:
`pip install google-api-python-client`

After doing so, import necessary libraries:

``` python 
    import requests # access to `GET` & `POST` requests to extract info from the Google Books API, and access to json to parse that info
    import random # allows you to generate random integers
```


#### app.py, models.py, & forms.py
To begin, make the following installations in the terminal:
* `pip install Flask`
* `pip install flask_bcrypt`
* `pip install flask_login`
* `pip install peewee`

While still in the terminal, run the python interpreter to obtain a secret key:
1. run `python3` to get to the interpreter
2. run `import secrets`
3. run `secrets.token_hex(16)`
4. save the secret key returned

Then, in `app.py`, you want to make sure you include your secret key that you generated by running the following:
```python
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "<USER SECRET KEY>"
```

Import the following in `models.py`:
```python
from flask_bcrypt import generate_password_hash # allows you to use bcrypt hashing in Flask so you can ensure password security
from flask_login import UserMixin # handles user login, logout, and session memory in Flask
from peewee import * # helps with database mapping in framework
```

Import the following in `forms.py`:
```python
from flask_wtf import Form
from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField, BooleanField, TextField 
from wtforms.validators import (
    DataRequired,
    ValidationError,
    Email,
    Length,
    EqualTo,
    Regexp,
) # uses wtforms to ensure users enter in valid information for login/registration
from models import User # imports function from our models.py
```

Import the following in `app.py`:
```python
import models #imports our models.py
import forms #imports our forms.py
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, flash, redirect, url_for, abort # allows you to use Flask as app's web framework and its functions
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt, check_password_hash # allows you to use bcrypt hashing in Flask so you can ensure password security
from flask_login import ( 
    LoginManager,
    LoginManager,
    login_user,a
    logout_user,
    login_required,
    current_user,
) # handles user login, logout, and session memory in Flask
```

Additionally, in app.py, you want to make sure you include your secret key that you generated by running the following:
```python
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "<USER SECRET KEY"
```

## Environment Functions and Important Variables
### Variables:
#### books.py
`api_key` – user's API key that will be used for the URL
`base_url` – base of url to be used for search-based `GET` requests to Google Books

#### app.py
`login_manager` – LoginManager Object

### Functions & Classes
#### books.py
`user_inputs` – function that takes in user inputs for user's preferred genre, author, or book that they want recommendations based on and returns info in tuple

`genre_recs` – function that returns dictionary of list of recommendations based on genre user inputted

`author_recs` – function that returns dictionary of list of recommendations based on author user inputted

`book_recs` – function that returns dictionary list of recommendations based on book user inputted

`output_recs` – function that runs the previous functions and prints each recommendation collected

### models.py
`User` – controls the data of users in the database

`Post` – controls the data of posts in the database

`Relationship` – controls the data of interactions between users in the database

### forms.py
`name_exist`, `email_exists` – functions that ensure that username and email user has submitted are legit/within databse of users

`Registration Form` – class that allows user to register for account on blog

`Login Form` – class that allows user to log in on blog

`PostForm` – handles posting on the blog


#### app.py
`register` – function that creates user registration by storing user details in `*Registration Form*` object from`forms.py`

`login` – function that performs user login using `forms.py`

`stream` – handles everything about how the app looks

`view_post` – function that renders all posts in database

`follow` – function that allows one user to follow another using `User` class object from `models.py` to get user information

`post` – function that uses `PostForm` function from `forms.py` to let user make a post


## How the App Works
When you join the app, you will have to sign up, then login. When you login, you will be able to view user posts, as well as the recommendations on the bottom of each post. If there is a book you want to talk about, you can create a post. When you create a post, make sure to enter the name in spelled correctly. When you submit your post, you will be taken back to the feed of posts and you should see what you wrote about the book, as well as newly generated recommendations for the book at the bottom from the Google Books API.
